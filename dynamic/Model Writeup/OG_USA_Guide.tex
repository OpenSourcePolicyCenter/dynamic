@\emph{Introduction}}%

This document details the large scale, overlapping-generations model developed by the Open Source Policy Center (OSPC).  The model allows for dynamic scoring of federal tax policy.  In particular, the model specifies the  fundamental parameters defining the preferences and technologies of heterogenous individuals and firms and links them together in a dynamic, general equilibrium framework.  This framework allows for detailed evaluation of tax policy, including revenue, distributional, and macroeconomic impacts.

The household sector consists of individuals of seven lifetime income groups, each of which has a different life-cycle earnings profiles.  This allow us to consider the lifetime incidence of taxation on households.  These individuals are intertemporal optimizers who allocate income between investment in financial assets and the consumption of 17 private consumption goods.  The consumption goods are produced by 48 different production sectors, which include 24 production industries with corporate and non-corporate firms in each.  In this way we can see the distributional impacts of consumption taxes and capital taxes levied on business entities as the taxes pass through to the individuals of different ages and income levels through changes in relative prices.  Finally, we specify a government sector that derives revenue from taxes and government enterprise and uses those revenues to subsidize government produced private and public goods and fund transfers.  The government is not bound by a balanced budget any particular period, but we do impose sustainable fiscal policy in the long run through a government reaction function that adjusts government purchases to maintain a specified debt-to-GDP ratio in the steady-state.

Our model is a general equilibrium model, meaning the taxes in one area of the economy result in effects on other sectors through changes in relative prices.  For example, the simulation of a policy that slows the rate of depreciation allowed under tax law would increase the cost of capital in capital intensive industries to a greater extent than it would in other industries.  This would have the effect of pushing up prices for goods produced from capital intensive industries and in turn move the economy back along the demand curve for those goods.  This happens as individuals substitute towards other goods that are relatively cheaper.  Thus demand for those goods produced from less capital intensive production increase.  Capturing general equilibrium feedback effects such as these can be very important for the evaluation of the distributional, revenue, and macroeconomic impacts of policies and is why dynamic scoring is important.

Our model is intended to provide year-by-year revenue estimates for the budget window.  To do this, we solve for not only the model's steady-state equilibrium, but also the entire transition path from the current state to the steady-state.  It's in this way that we are able to see the revenue and macroeconomic impacts over the budget window.

The remainder of this document provides a detailed description of the model.  We start by specifying households and then outline the firm's problem.  We next turn to the specification of the government.  Finally we define the equilibrium concept used to close the model and the numerical solution methods used to solve for this equilibrium.

A future extension to this document will detail how the model is calibrated.

\section{Characteristics of exogenous population growth assumptions}\label{AppPopGrowth}

  In this appendix, we describe in detail the exogenous population growth assumptions in the model and their implications. In Section \ref{SecPopDyn}, we define the laws of motion for the population of each cohort $\omega_{s,t}$ to be the following.
  \begin{equation}\tag{\ref{EqPopLawofmotion}}
    \begin{split}
      \omega_{1,t+1} &= \sum_{s=1}^{E+S} f_s\omega_{s,t}\quad\forall t \\
        \omega_{s+1,t+1} &= (1 + i_s - \rho_s)\omega_{s,t}\quad\forall t\quad\text{and}\quad 1\leq s \leq E+S-1
    \end{split}
  \end{equation}
  We can transform the nonstationary equations in \eqref{EqPopLawofmotion} into stationary laws of motion by dividing both sides by the total populations $N_t$ and $N_{t+1}$ in both periods,
  \begin{equation}\label{EqPopLawofmotionStat}
    \begin{split}
      \hat{\omega}_{1,t+1} &= \frac{\sum_{s=1}^{E+S} f_s\hat{\omega}_{s,t}}{1+g_{n,t+1}}\quad\forall t \\
      \hat{\omega}_{s+1,t+1} &= \frac{(1 + \phi_s - \rho_s)\hat{\omega}_{s,t}}{1+g_{n,t+1}}\quad\forall t\quad\text{and}\quad 1\leq s \leq E+S-1
    \end{split}
  \end{equation}
  where $\hat{\omega}_{s,t}$ is the percent of the total population in age cohort $s$ and the population growth rate $g_{n,t+1}$ between periods $t$ and $t+1$ is defined in \eqref{EqPopGrowth},
  \begin{equation}\label{EqPopLOMbig}
  \begin{split}
    & \begin{bmatrix}
      \hat{\omega}_{1,t+1} \\ \hat{\omega}_{2,t+1} \\ \hat{\omega}_{2,t+1} \\ \vdots \\ \hat{\omega}_{E+S-1,t+1} \\ \hat{\omega}_{E+S,t+1}
    \end{bmatrix}= \frac{1}{1 + g_{n,t+1}} \times ... \\
    & \begin{bmatrix}
      f_1 & f_2 & f_3 & \hdots & f_{E+S-1} & f_{E+S} \\
      1+i_1-\rho_1 & 0 & 0 & \hdots & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1+i_2-\rho_2 & 0 & \hdots & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1+i_3-\rho_3 & \hdots & 0 & 0 \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & \hdots & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & \hdots & 1+i_{E+S-1}-\rho_{E+S-1} & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \hat{\omega}_{1,t} \\ \hat{\omega}_{2,t} \\ \hat{\omega}_{2,t} \\ \vdots \\ \hat{\omega}_{E+S-1,t} \\ \hat{\omega}_{E+S,t}
    \end{bmatrix}
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}
  where we restrict $1+i_s-\rho_s\geq 0$ for all $s$.

  We write \eqref{EqPopLOMbig} in matrix notation as the following.
  \begin{equation}\label{EqPopLOMmat}
    \bm{\hat{\omega}}_{t+1} = \frac{1}{1+g_{n,t+1}}\bm{\Omega}\bm{\hat{\omega}}_t \quad\forall t
  \end{equation}
  The stationary steady state population distribution $\bm{\bar{\omega}}$ is the eigenvector $\bm{\omega}$ with eigenvalue $(1+\bar{g}_n)$ of the matrix $\bm{\Omega}$ that satisfies the following version of \eqref{EqPopLOMmat}.
  \begin{equation}\label{EqPopLOMss}
    (1+\bar{g}_n)\bm{\bar{\omega}} = \bm{\Omega}\bm{\bar{\omega}}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{proposition}
    There exists a unique positive real eigenvector $\bf\bar\omega$ of the matrix $\bf\Omega$, and it is a stable equilibrium.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{proof}
    First, note that the matrix $\bf\Omega$ is square and non-negative.  This is enough for a general version of the Perron-Frobenius Theorem to state that a positive real eigenvector exists with a positive real eigenvalue.  This is not yet enough for uniqueness.  For it to be unique by a version of the Perron-Fobenius Theorem, we need to know that the matrix is irreducible.  This can be easily shown.  The matrix is of the form
    $$\bf\Omega =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    	* & *  & * & \hdots & * & * & *\\
    	* & 0 & 0 & \hdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    	0 & * & 0 & \hdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    	0 & 0 & 0 & \hdots & *  & 0 & 0 \\
    	0 & 0 & 0 & \hdots & 0 & * & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    Where each * is strictly positive.  It is clear to see that taking powers of the matrix causes the sub-diagonal positive elements to be moved down a row and another row of positive entries is added at the top.  None of these go to zero since the elements were all non-negative to begin with.
    $$\bf\Omega^2 =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    	* & *  & * & \hdots & * & * & *\\
    	* & * & * & \hdots & * & * & * \\
    	* & 0 & 0 & \hdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    	0 & 0 & 0 & \hdots & 0  & 0 & 0 \\
    	0 & 0 & 0 & \hdots & * & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}; ~~~
    \bf\Omega^{S+E-1} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    	* & *  & * & \hdots & * & * & *\\
    	* & * & * & \hdots & * & * & * \\
    	* & * & * & \hdots & * & * & * \\
    	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    	* & * & * & \hdots & * & * & * \\
    	* & 0 & 0 & \hdots & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    $$\bf\Omega^{S+E} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    	* & *  & * & \hdots & * & * & *\\
    	* & * & * & \hdots & * & * & * \\
    	* & * & * & \hdots & * & * & * \\
    	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    	* & * & * & \hdots & * & * & * \\
    	* & * & * & \hdots & * & * & *
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    Existence of an $m \in \mathbb N $ such that $\left(\bf\Omega^m\right)_{ij} \neq 0 ~~ ( > 0)$ is one of the definitions of an irreducible (primitive) matrix.  It is equivalent to saying that the directed graph associated with the matrix is strongly connected.  Now the Perron-Frobenius Theorem for irreducible matrices gives us that the equilibrium vector is unique.

    We also know from that theorem that the eigenvalue associated with the positive real eigenvector will be real and positive.  This eigenvalue, $p$, is the Perron eigenvalue and it is the steady state population growth rate of the model.  By the PF Theorem for irreducible matrices, $| \lambda_i | \leq p$ for all eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ and there will be exactly $h$ eigenvalues that are equal, where $h$ is the period of the matrix.  Since our matrix $\bf\Omega$ is aperiodic, the steady state growth rate is the unique largest eigenvalue in magnitude.  This implies that almost all initial vectors will converge to this eigenvector under iteration.
  \end{proof}

  For a full treatment and proof of the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, see \citet{Suzumura:1983}. Because the population growth process is exogenous to the model, we calibrate it to annual age data for age years $s=1$ to $s=100$. As is shown in Figure \ref{FigPerTime}, period $s=1$ corresponds to the first year of life between birth and when an individual turns one year old.

    \fbox{\resizebox{4.0in}{2.0in}{\includegraphics{images/FigPerTime.pdf}}}
  \end{figure}

  Our initial population distribution $\{\omega_{s,1}\}_{s=1}^{100}$ in Figure \ref{FigInitPopDist} comes from \citet{Census:2014} population estimates for both sexes for 2013. The fertility rates $\{f_s\}_{s=1}^{100}$ in Figure \ref{FigFertRates} come from \citet[Table 1]{NVSR:2010}. The mortality rates $\{\rho_s\}_{s=1}^{99}$ in Figure \ref{FigMortRates} come from the 2010 death probabilities in \citet{SocSec:2010}. We enforce a strict maximum age mortality rate of $\rho_{100}=1$ in our model.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]\centering \captionsetup{width=4.0in}

  \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}[htbp]\centering \captionsetup{width=4.0in}

    \fbox{\resizebox{4.0in}{2.8in}{\includegraphics{images/mort_rates.png}}}
  \end{figure}

  The immigration rates $\{i_s\}_{s=1}^{99}$ in Figure \ref{FigImmigRates} are essentially residuals. We take total population for two consecutive years $N_t$ and $N_{t+1}$ and the population distribution by age in both of those years $\bm{\omega}_{t}$ and $\bm{\omega}_{t+1}$from the \citet{Census:2014} data. We then deduce the immigration rates $\{i_s\}_{s=1}^{99}$ using equation \eqref{EqPopLawofmotionStat}. We do this for three consecutive sets of years, so that our calibrated immigration rates by age are the average of our three years of deduced rates from the data for each age.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]\centering \captionsetup{width=4.0in}
    \caption{\label{FigImmigRates}\textbf{Immigration rates $i_s$ by year, $1\leq s\leq 100$}}
    \fbox{\resizebox{4.0in}{2.8in}{\includegraphics{images/imm_rates.png}}}
  \end{figure}

  Figure \ref{FigPopPath} shows the predicted time path of the total population $N_t$ given $\omega_{s,1}$ $f_s$, $i_s$, and $\rho_s$. Notice that the population approaches a constant growth rate. This is a result of the stationary population percent distribution $\bm{\bar{\omega}}$ eventually being reached. Figure \ref{FigSSpopdist} shows the steady-state population percent distribution by age $\bm{\bar{\omega}}$.

  \end{itemize}

\section{Calibration}
  \subsection{Tax Bend Points}
      We use IRS data which summarizes individual tax returns for 2011 by 19 income categories and 4 filing statuses.  For each filing status we fit the mapping from reported income into adjusted gross income (AGI) using a sufficiently high-order polynomial.  We then use this function to solve for the income level which corresponds to each of the five bend points in the tax code for each filing type.
      \begin{table}[ht]
        \caption{AGI and Income Bend Points}
        \label{Calib_Bend_Tab1}

        \end{tabular}
      \end{table}

      We then fit a bivariate probability density function over income and filing type from the data.  For each bendpoint we calculate the probability density at that bendpoint and use these as weights in a weighted average over filing types to generate an aggregate bendpoint.
